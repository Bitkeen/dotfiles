## Dotfiles
I use GNU Stow to create symlinks for my dotfiles.

The repository should be cloned to `~/.dotfiles`.

Example: to setup Vim, simply run `stow vim` inside.

#### Python packages
Packages that I want to have installed on my machines
are in the `requirements.txt` file.

Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
